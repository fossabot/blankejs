# What?

**Assets** are images, sounds, fonts, scenes. Just about anything that isn't Lua code (a script).

# How do I add them?

## BlankE IDE

All supported file types can be drag and dropped onto the IDE. Some types can be added through the search bar by searching `Add a <asset type>`.

## Project folder

All assets are stored in `<project folder>/assets/<asset type>`. They can also be placed here manually. The IDE _usually_ automatically updates whenever an asset is added manually.

# Supported File Types

**Image** png, jpg, jpeg

**Audio** mp3, wav, ogg/oga/ogv, mid

**Font** ttf, ttc, cff, woff, otf, otc, pfa, pfb, fnt, bdf, pfr
